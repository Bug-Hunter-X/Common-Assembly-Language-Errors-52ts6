mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ;This instruction assumes that ecx is a valid index into the array pointed to by ebx. If ecx is too large or negative, it will lead to an out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in a segmentation fault or other runtime error.  
mov [eax], 10 ;This instruction writes the value 10 to the memory location pointed to by eax. If eax does not point to a writable memory location, it will cause an access violation.  
jmp eax; This instruction jumps to the address specified in eax. If eax does not contain a valid memory address, it will result in unpredictable behavior or a crash.
